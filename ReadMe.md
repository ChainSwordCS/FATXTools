# FATXTools
This is a C# port of the Python version of [fatx-tools](https://github.com/aerosoul94/fatx-tools).

This is still a work in progress and I do not recommend using these over the Python version just yet.

Planned improvements from the Python version should include:
* better performance
* nicer GUI
* compressed image handling
* physical drive handling
* more detailed analysis tools

However these will only be compatible on Windows.
